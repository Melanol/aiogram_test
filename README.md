A Telegram bot I made as a test for a potential job.

Installation:
Clone the directory and create a file called ".env" in the project's root folder, 
put there your Telegram bot token and OpenWeather API key that you have to get yourself. File format:

BOT_API_TOKEN={BOT_API_TOKEN}<br/>
WEATHER_API_KEY={WEATHER_API_KEY}
